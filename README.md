# Candlestick-chart-pattern-screeners

When you run the program app.py, the Flask framework will open a localhost site that looks like the below image:

To begin, you would need to click the "Refresh and Fetch Updated Data" button so that the app can fetch the latest price action for the cryptocurrencies.
If you do not click Refresh, the data that the program works on will be old data.

Next, you need to scroll through the dropdown menu, and select a specific candlestick pattern you want to scan for.
For example, I want to search for the "Shooting Star" pattern:

Then, click Scan.
If and only if there are any coins that display and fit the chart pattern you're filtering for, the symbol(s), respective coin names, and whether the pattern is a Bullish or Bearish signal, will be shown on the screen. 
The respective price graph of the cryptocurrencies will also be displayed.
